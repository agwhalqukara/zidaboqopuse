But I got to work with John Frankenheimer. I wasn’t lying to myself–that’s why I did it.”</p><p>(Photo by Ian Gavan/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/458669612.jpg alt="Academy Of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences' 2014 Governors Awards - Arrivals" width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>9. Mark Wahlberg</strong></p><p>Mark Wahlberg’s career hit a bit of a speed bump after the release of the 2008 film, The Happening. &nbsp;Although Walhberg’s performance received many positive reviews, the film was an overall flop. &nbsp;Critics gave the film negative reviews and questioned director M. Night Shyamalan’s film making skills. &nbsp;Wahlberg himself was critical of the film and joked about his role stating: “…you can’t blame me for not wanting to try to play a science teacher. At least I wasn’t playing a cop or a crook.”</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/186681453.jpg alt="LACMA 2013 Art + Film Gala - Arrivals" width=640 height=462 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>8.

After the release of his 2008 film, Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, LaBeouf made several tongue-in-cheek comments when he stated: “I think the audience is pretty intelligent. I think they know when you’ve made [a bad movie].”</p><p>(Photo by Tim P.

Megan Fox</strong></p><p>After appearing in the 2009 sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, actress Megan Fox expressed her frustrating with the film. &nbsp;Although the film was meant to be an enjoyable action film, Fox felt as though it was too difficult to understand. &nbsp;Fox told CBS: “I’m in the movie and I read the script and I watched the movie and I still didn’t know what was happening. I think if you haven’t read the script and you go and see it and understand it, you may be a genius.

I specifically hadn’t done anything which anyone would see since&nbsp;<i>Harry Potter</i>&nbsp;because I wanted to teach myself how to act. I didn’t want to be an idiot. This came kind of randomly and I didn’t really know what it was when it first started. I was going to wait for another year. I wanted to do two or three more little things and then do something bigger. And then this kind of happened and I was like, ‘Well, okay…”</p><p>(Photo by Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/187527788.jpg alt="2013 BAFTA LA Jaguar Britannia Awards Presented by BBC America - Show" width=640 height=483 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>3. George Clooney</strong></p><p>It’s no secret that George Clooney (and everyone else) has been very critical about his role as Batman in the 1997 film, Batman & Robin. &nbsp;However, thanks to his self-awareness and good sense of humor, Clooney has been able to move past the horrible film. &nbsp;Years after the film debuted, Clooney apologized for ruining the Batman franchise and stated: ““I think since Batman that I’ve been disinvited from Comic-Con for 20 years. I see the comment sections on all you guys. I just met Adam West there [referring to behind the NYCC main stage] and I apologized to him.&nbsp;Sorry about the nipples on the suit.

Although the popular comedy film Knocked Up was a hit among fans, Heigl didn’t seem to find humor in the film’s portrayal of women. &nbsp;Heigl stated: “It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days.</p><p>(Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/481516747.jpg alt='"Divergent" - European Premiere - Red Carpet Arrivals' width=640 height=484 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1. Kate Winslet</strong></p><p>Kate Winslet is best known for her role in the award-winning film Titanic. &nbsp;In the years since its release, Titanic has become one of the most memorable and well-liked films of the 90s. &nbsp;However, Winslet has often been critical of the film, and has stated that she does not enjoy watching her performance. Winslet has said: “Every single scene, I’m like ‘Really, really? You did it like that? Oh my God.&nbsp;Even my American accent, I can’t listen to it. It’s awful.” Winslet has also revealed that even hearing the film’s famous theme song “My Heart Will Go On” has left her with &nbsp;“a massive internal eye roll.”</p><p>(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2K6orDEZp2upl2ivLe1xKxm</p></div><div id=links><a href=./catherine-grimme.html>&#171;&nbsp;Catherine Grimme</a>
