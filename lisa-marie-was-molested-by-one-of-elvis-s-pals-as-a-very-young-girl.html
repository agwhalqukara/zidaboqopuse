Then died. Priscilla seemed really self-involved, she was focused on her acting career and running Graceland. Both parents were in arrested development. Thus Lisa Marie was neglected and ended up emotionally fragile. She had money to get psychiatric help but I don't think mental illness and how it's genetic was taken seriously then. She instead just dated and married any man who gave her the time of day and was eager to have kids. She couldn't handle being alone with herself first and used others to feel the empty void inside.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 6</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 17, 2023 9:43 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>[Quote]Lisa Marie Presley is reliving her disturbing past all over again.</p><p>How old is that article?

I've got the book and only read it once. In it he describes how he first fell in love with Priscilla but then started having romantic feelings for 13 yr old Lisa Marie. As she was growing up he said the feelings became more intense. I believe he was molesting her and also thinking about her inheritance that she'd be getting in a few years. When he told Priscilla he was having "feelings" for Lisa Marie, she swiftly kicked him out. It only took him 6 months to write that mess of a book. In it he tells in his own words, about how when Priscilla wasn't around ( which wasn't often) he'd treat Lisa like an adult Woman and wanted to be the one to introduce her to sex. He came off as really opportunistic and extremely vain. He was a model when he met Priscilla and she fell for him hard. He moved into their house 2 weeks later and they stayed together for 7 yrs. I've thought about what I'd read in that book from time to time and I'm not surprised at all about that article. He totally came off as a scumbag. Priscilla, for her part wasn't around for Lisa very much either. She was trying to get her acting career going and was totally involved with Scientology, which she had Lisa in as well. It was a creepy book and I remember thinking, why would someone write this? He was definitely using Priscilla and then turned his attention to Lisa in a disturbing way. I always believed Lisa's life was no bed of roses, and if Elvis had lived he probably wouldn't have liked any of what was happening. Whether he would have been in the shape to be paying attention to what was happening to his Daughter, I don't know.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 14</td><td class=timestamp><span>January 20, 2023 9:15 AM</span></td></tr></table><p>That's a really ugly thing to say, r4.
