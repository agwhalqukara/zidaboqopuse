id=what-thandie-newton8217s-net-worth><strong>What is Thandie Newton's Net Worth and Salary?</strong></h2><p>Thandie Newton is a British-born actress and model who has a net worth of $14 million. Today, Newton is famous for a range of starring roles in some of the most memorable films of recent memory. She has appeared in the "Mission: Impossible" film franchise and the "Star Wars" movie series. Outside of her film work, Thandie is probably best known for her role as an android prostitute in the critically-acclaimed HBO TV series "Westworld."</p><p>Over the course of her career, she has won a Primetime Emmy Award, two Critics Choice Awards, a Golden Globe Award, a Saturn Award, and many others. Outside of her acting career, Thandie is considered one of the best-dressed women in the world and was named in many top style rankings in 2018. In addition, Newton is considered one of the most influential women in the United Kingdom. A proud vegan, Thandie was named the "Sexiest Vegan of 2014" by PETA in 2014.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Melanie Thandiwe Newton was born on November 6th of 1972 in Westminster, London, England. Her mother was a princess of Zimbabwean royalty, and her father was a lab technician with English heritage. Her middle name Thandiwe later became Newton's stage name, and it means "beloved" in the Nguni language of the Bantu people.</p><p>As a young girl, Newton attended a Catholic school. Due to her race and her family's atheism, she was quickly ostracized and made to feel like an outsider. She admits that she was asked to sit out of school photos, and she was often humiliated for a number of reasons. As a young girl, Newton also studied dance in London. After graduating from secondary school, she attended Cambridge and earned a degree in social anthropology.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-237551 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Thandie-Newton.jpg alt="Thandie Newton Net Worth" width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-237551 class=wp-caption-text>Rich Polk/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Thandie's film career took off in 1991 with "Flirting," after which she booked a role in "Interview with the Vampire" in 1994.

Although the film was a commercial success, Thandie Newton later revealed that she was intimidated by Cruise on set. She admitted that he would switch roles with her in order to show her how he wanted her to act in certain scenes. As anyone in the acting industry will tell you, this is a major no-no and a huge sign of disrespect.</p><p>After starring in the low-budget film "It Was an Accident," Newton booked a recurring role on the television series "ER." Towards the mid-2000s, she followed up with notable film roles in movies like "Crash" and "Chronicles of Riddick."

Thandie was singled out for praise by critics, winning a vast number of awards in recognition of her performance. In 2018, she booked the role of Val in the film "Solo: A Star Wars Series," which is widely considered to be one of the worst Star Wars films of all time.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-309493 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Thandie-Newton-1.jpg alt width=703 height=1024 sizes="(max-width: 703px) 100vw, 703px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-309493 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=sexual-abuse><strong>Sexual Abuse</strong></h2><p>In 2016, Thandie revealed that she had been sexually abused during an audition she had gone to as a teenager.
